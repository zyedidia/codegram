# CodeGram: Creating ISA Encoders and Decoders with Decision Diagrams

Tools for evaluating a multi-terminal BDD that can encode/decode x86-64
instructions. The BDD (in `generated/x86.dot`) was generated by CUDD.

Generate a test decoder:

```
$ knit test
$ ./test # run the test
```

Generate a test encoder:

```
$ knit encode
$ ./encode # auto-generate 1000 random instructions
```
